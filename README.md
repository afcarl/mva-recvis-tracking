MVA -- Object Recognition & Graphical Models Project
====================================================

This small readme file has only some basic info on the code structure.
I didn't write an extensive documentation, and while I did spend a lot of time on this project, please bear in mind that it is a research project.
As such, the code might be a little messy, and not always easily understandable. I'm sorry about that, but heck, you're getting it for free!
However, if you have small questions, I'd be happy to answer them, you can find me on G+ (http://gplus.to/fxthomas), Twitter and LinkedIn (although I'm much more likely to answer on G+).

You can copy/paste/modify my code however you want, but I'd ask that you put my name in the credits, that's a small way to say "thank you!".

What is going on here ?
-----------------------

This is a small research project about understanding, implementing and testing a paper by _Hamed Pirsiavash, Deva Ramanan and Charless C. Fowlkes_ called **"Globally-Optimal Greedy Algorithms for Tracking a Variable Number of Objects"**.
You can find my project report on the _"Downloads"_ section of this GitHub repository, as well as on the _"Report"_ directory of the project.

Where to get data ?
-------------------

The data I used in this project came from two sources, so feel free to check them out :

 * **Part-Based Object Detector** : http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pff/latent/
 * **ETH Moving Sequences Dataset** : http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~aess/dataset/

That's all folks! See my report for more, and hope you like it!
